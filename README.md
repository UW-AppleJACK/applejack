# AppleJACK

As part of the Informatics capstone, weâ€™re designing and developing a solution for 3rd - 5th grade students to learn about the natural world through being involved in a citizen science project. Our project will integrate the data collection activity, educational resources for parents and students, and a gamification component into the project or lesson.
